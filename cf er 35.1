You are given an array of n integer numbers a0, a1, ..., an - 1. Find the distance between two closest (nearest) minimums in it. It is 
guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
Input
The first line contains positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — size of the given array. The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1
(1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
Output
Print the only number — distance between two nearest minimums in the array.

n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
b= min(a)
c= a.index(b)
co=a.count(b)
p=1
ans=900000
for i in range(c+1,n):
    if a[i]==b:
        tans=i-c
        c=i
        if tans<ans:
            ans=tans
        p+=1
        if p==co:
            break
        
print(ans)
